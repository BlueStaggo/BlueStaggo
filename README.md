I'm @BlueStaggo! My favourite programming language is C# and my favourite game library is [Raylib](https://raylib.com). You can also find pixel equivalents of 10pt for various fonts for Visual Studio Code [over here](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/BlueStaggo/blob/main/VSCode%2010pt.md) on my personal repo.
